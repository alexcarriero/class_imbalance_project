OUTPUT FOR ONE ITERATION: 


Each iteration of the simulation produces four files, each file is saved in a distinct folder: 
iteration_info, per_iter_results, predictions, and rep_checks. 


All four files bare the same name, for scenario X iteration Y, the four files are named scX_Y.rds.  
Thus after iteration Y of simulation scenario X the result is, 


sim_results > iteration_info   > scX_Y.rds
sim_results > per_iter_results > scX_Y.rds
sim_results > predictions      > scX_Y.rds 
sim_results > rep_checks       > scX_Y.rds 


where each of the files contain distinct information. 


ITERATION INFO


A 30 x 15 data frame where each row corresponds to a distinct class imbalance correction - machine learning algorithm pair (30 prediction models were developed for each iteration in our simulation). Columns are as follows. 

scenario  : an integer between 1 and 18 recording the simulation scenario 

pair_id   :  an integer between 1 and 30 reporting the pair_id 
	  (a number which encodes a unique combination of imbalance correction and machine learning algorithm)

correction: character specifying the imbalance correction 

algorithm : character specifying the algorithm 

iter      : integer between 1 and 2000 specifying the iteration 

seed      : the seed used for this iteration 

sc_ef     : scenario event fraction, one of the following 3 values (0.5, 0.2, 0.02) 

obs_ef    : observed event fraction, the event fraction observed in the training data 

new_ef    : the event fraction as calculated after the implementation of the imbalance correction 

c_problem : a binary indicator indicating if there was a problem with the imbalance correction 

c_warn    : a character reporting any warning message generated as a result of the imbalance correction 

c_err     : a character reporting any error message generated as a results of the imbalance correction 

a_problem : a binary indicator indicating if there was a problem with the machine learning algorithm 

a_warn    : a character reporting any warning message generated as a result of the machine learning algorithm 

a_err     : a character reporting any error message generated as a result of the machine learning algorithm 



PER_ITER_RESULTS 


A 30 x 28 data frame where each row corresponds to a distinct class imbalance correction - machine learning algorithm pair (30 prediction models were developed for each iteration in our simulation).  In this data frame, the first 15 columns are redundant to ITERATION INFO.  The remaining columns are as follows: 

min       : the smallest value for a predicted risk in the validation set 

max       : the largest value for a predicted risk in the validation set 

var       : the variance of the predicted risks from the validation set 

auc       : the concordance statistic, calculated using the predicted risks from the validation set 

bri       : the scaled brier score, calculated using the predicted risks from the validation set 

int       : the calibration intercept, calculated using the predicted risks form the validation set 

slp       : the calibration slope, calculated using the predicted risks from the validation set 

int_warn  : character displaying any warning generated when calculating the calibration intercept 

int_count : binary indicator indicating the presence of a warning when calculating calibration intercept 

slp_warn  : character displaying any warning generated when calculating the calibration slope 

slp_count : binary indicator indicating the presence of a warning when calculating calibration slope 

invalid_0 : binary indicator indicating if any predicted risks were below 0 

invalid_1 : binary indicator indicating if any predicted risks were above 1



PREDICTIONS 

A (30 * n) x 8 data frame where n is the size of the validation set for the iteration. Each row corresponds to one observation in the validation data set.  Thus, there are 30*N rows since there are 30 prediction models per iteration and we store the predicted risks for the entire validation set for all models. Columns are as follows: 


pred      : the predicted risk for a given observation in the validation set 

iter      : and integer between 1 and 2000 representing the iteration 

class     : the true observed class for a given observation in the validation set 

problem   : an indicator if there was a problem producing predicted risks 
           (i.e., a problem when making predictions based on a given machine learning algorithm. 

scenario  : an integer between 1 and 18 representing the simulation scenario 

pair_id   : an integer between 1 and 30 repressing the unique combination of imbalance correction and machine learning algorithm 

correction: a character specifying the imbalance correction 

algorithm : a character specifying the machine learning algorithm 



REP_CHECKS 

A 30 x 6 data frame where each row corresponds to a distinct class imbalance correction - machine learning algorithm pair (30 prediction models were developed for each iteration in our simulation).  Columns are as follows: 

dataframe   : the last value of the first predictor in the training set 

testframe   : the last value of the first predictor in the validation set 

c_dataframe : the last value of the first predictor in the class-imbalance corrected training set 

iter        : an integer between 1 and 2000 representing the iteration 

pair_id     : an integer between 1 and 30 identifying the unique combination of imbalance correction and machine learning algorithm 

scenario    : an integer between 1 and 18 identifying the simulation scenario
